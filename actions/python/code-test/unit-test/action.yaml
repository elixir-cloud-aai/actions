          **üö® CI Failure: Setup Step**

          Hi @${{ inputs.username }},

          The **`unit test`** CI has encountered a failure during the 
          **`setup`** step.

          **Action Required:**
          Please review your `pyproject.toml` file to ensure that the dependency groups,
          especially the `test` and main groups, are correctly defined.

          **Environment Details:**
          <details>
          <summary>Enviroment</summary>
          - **Operating System:** ${{ inputs.os }}
          - **Python Version:** ${{ inputs.python_version }}
          - **Poetry Install Options:** `${{ inputs.poetry_install_options }}`
          - **Poetry Export Options:** `${{ inputs.poetry_export_options }}`
          </details>

          If you need assistance, please refer to the [Poetry documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/),
          or reach out to the maintainers.

          **üß™ Unit Tests and Dependency Check Failed**
          
          Hi @${{ inputs.username }},
          
          The **unit tests** in your project have encountered failures, and 
          there might be issues with your dependencies as defined in 
          `pyproject.toml`.
          
          ---
          
          ### **üìå Action Required**
          
          Please address the following to resolve the issues:
          
          1. **Review Unit Tests:**
             
             - **File Path:** `${{ inputs.file_path }}`
             - Examine the failing unit tests to identify the root cause of 
              the failures.
          
          2. **Check Dependencies:**
             
             - Open your `pyproject.toml` file.
             - Ensure that all dependencies are correctly specified and 
              there are no version conflicts or missing packages.
          
          3. **Run Unit Tests Locally:**
             
             Execute the following command to run the unit tests and view 
             detailed error reports:
             
             ```bash
             poetry run pytest --cov=${{ inputs.file_path }}
             ```
             
             - **`--cov=${{ inputs.file_path }}`**: Generates a coverage 
              report for the specified file path.
             - **Benefits:**
               - Identifies untested parts of your code.
               - Helps in understanding which tests are failing and why.
          
          4. **Fix Identified Issues:**
             
             - Address the errors reported by the unit tests.
             - Update or modify your code and dependencies as necessary to pass 
              all tests.

          <details>
          <summary>Running Tests with Coverage</summary>
          
          **Coverage Reports:**
          
          - **Purpose:** Coverage reports help you understand how much of your 
            codebase is exercised by your tests.
          - **Benefits:**
            - Ensures critical parts of your application are tested.
            - Identifies untested code that might be prone to bugs.
          
          **Interpreting Test Results:**
          
          - **Failed Tests:** Review the stack traces and error messages to 
            identify and fix issues.
          - **Coverage Metrics:** Aim for a high coverage percentage to 
            maintain code quality, but prioritize meaningful tests over sheer 
            coverage numbers.
          
          **Best Practices:**
          
          - **Write Descriptive Test Cases:** Ensure that each test clearly 
            describes what it's verifying.
          - **Isolate Tests:** Each test should run independently to prevent
            cascading failures.
          - **Regularly Run Tests Locally:** Integrate test runs into your 
            local development workflow to catch issues early.

          **üö® Codecov Token Missing**
          
          Hi @${{ inputs.username }},
          
          The **Codecov** token is missing from your repository's secrets. As 
          a result, the coverage report was successfully generated but **was not 
          uploaded** to Codecov.
          
          ---
          
          ### **üìå Action Required**
          
          To ensure that coverage reports are uploaded correctly in future runs,
          please follow these steps:
          
          1. **Obtain the Codecov Token:**
            
            - If you do not have the Codecov token, you can retrieve it from 
              [Codecov account](https://codecov.io/).
            - Navigate to repository settings within Codecov to find the token.
          
          2. **Add the Token to GitHub Secrets:**
            
            - Go to your GitHub repository.
            - Click on **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.
            - Click on **New repository secret**.
            - Enter the following details:
              - **Name:** `CODECOV_TOKEN`
              - **Value:** *Your Codecov token*
            - Click **Add secret** to save.
          
          3. **Verify the Setup:**
            
            - After adding the secret, trigger the workflow again to ensure 
              that the coverage report is uploaded successfully.
            - Check the GitHub Actions logs and Codecov dashboard for 
              confirmation.
